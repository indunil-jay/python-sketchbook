#  print() function will print anything you put inside its parentheses.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Each print() instruction prints on a new line.
print('Hello world')  # 'hello world'
print(40)  # 40


#print function can do arithmatic operation before returning a result.
print(40+1) # 41

print('one'+'two') #onetwo

print("hello" + 40)   # Type Error : can only concatenate str (not "int") to str



#NOTE:
# what is python ?
   #simple answer is that it is a  high-level, general purpose programming language that is used for variety of purpose  inculding back-end development, data-analaysis, Machine learning, AI,etc.

# Python is known for beign simple to read and write.

# what is code  ?
    #code is just a series of instruction for computer or (compiler to ) to follow  ro achive some certain task (work,software).

# what is syntax erro in programming ?
    #A syntax error is a mistake in a program's code that occurs when a programmer breaks the rules of the programming language. Syntax errors can be caused by:
            # Misspelling commands
            # Using punctuation incorrectly
            # Incorrect labels
            # Missing punctuation
            # Misordered commands
            # Missing semicolons
            # Unbalanced parenthesis
            # Missing operators
            # Indentation
            # Error in the structure of the program

           # When a syntax error occurs, the code will not run and an error message will appear in the console. The error message will usually start with "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" and will indicate the location of the error in the code

        # Syntax: The rules for how expressions and statements should be structured in a language.


# Syntax errors aren't the only kind of problems you can run into when coding, for example:
        # 1.A bug in your logic. You code is valid, and will run, but it doesn't something unexpected.
        # 2.It's too slow. Your code is valid and does what's expected, but it does it slowly




# The Zen of Python

# Tim Peters, a long time Pythonista, describes the guiding principles of Python in his famous short piece, The Zen of Python.

#     Beautiful is better than ugly.

#     Explicit is better than implicit.

#     Simple is better than complex.

#     Complex is better than complicated.

#     Flat is better than nested.

#     Sparse is better than dense.

#     Readability counts.

#     Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

#     Although practicality beats purity.

#     Errors should never pass silently.

#     Unless explicitly silenced.

#     In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

#     There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

#     Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

#     Now is better than never.

#     Although never is often better than right now.

#     If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

#     If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

#     Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
